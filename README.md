# MIPS-MultiCycle
A Multi Cycle implementation of MIPS

## How it works ? 

This CPU have an `8bit` data bus and a `13bit` address bus.
All of Instruction are 8 or 16 bit.
This CPU have these registers : 
* 4 Accumulator registers (AC0, AC1, AC2, AC3) that contains CPU register file 
* 1 13bits register named Temporary (TR)
* 1 5bits register named Direction Register (DI)
* 1 3bits rgister named Status Register (CZN)
* 1 8bits ALU
